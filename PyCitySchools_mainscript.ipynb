The biggest improvement shown is 2% improvement at max, for example, Griffin High School in Year 11 but then drops at Year 12 by 3%.

However, the second and third hgihest total school budget $3,094,650 in Johnson High School and $3,0222,020 in Hernandez High School show a low % passing score, 67% and 66%, respectively. So perhaps more attention and different implementations would need to be given to Johnson and Hernandez High Schools to improve their % overall passing.\n",
